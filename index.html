            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Jared. Welcome to my professional coding portfolio! Here is some info about myself. I enjoy various outside activities such as: hiking, basketball, swimming, and skateboarding. I'm an avid video gamer, who's favorite genres are RPGs, FPSs, and fighting games. I'm hopeful to become a video game coder so I can work in the gaming industry! My past work experience is mostly delivery driving, but I was a Quality Assurance tester for Activision. I would love to jump back into the video game industry and contribute as much as I can! If you would like to know anything else about me give me call!</p>
